# Machine Learning with Python

Here I present machine learning codes written in Python mostly from scratch, i.e.
without invoking specialized libraries.
Most of them (folders 1-8) are based on my solutions to exercises from Stanford machine learning course
at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I decided to add few other projects for completeness, namely NLP, RNN, Reinforcement Learning etc.
